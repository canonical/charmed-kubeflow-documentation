Uninstall
=========

This guide describes how to uninstall Charmed Kubeflow (CKF).

---------------------
Remove Kubeflow model
---------------------

Remove the Juju model containing your Kubeflow deployment as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   juju destroy-model kubeflow --destroy-storage

If you chose a different name other than ``kubeflow`` for the model, substitute it in the command above. 
This will remove all the applications under that Kubernetes namespace, and then remove the namespace itself.

If needed, you can force the deletion of the model as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   juju destroy-model kubeflow --yes --destroy-storage --force

Alternatively, you can also simply release storage instead of deleting the model by using the following flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   juju destroy-model kubeflow --release-storage

----------------------
Remove Juju controller
----------------------

You may want to remove the Juju controller to free up resources. 
To do so, run the following command including the controller name, ``my-controller`` in this example:

.. code-block:: bash

   juju destroy-controller my-controller
